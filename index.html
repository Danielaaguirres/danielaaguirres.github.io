    <h2>âœ¨ About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Iâ€™m Daniela Aguirre, and my story begins in Ecuadorâ€”where I learned early on that big dreams require both vision and action.
    </p>

    <p>
      I earned my undergraduate degree in Finance and Marketing, with a minor in Data Analytics, graduating magna cum laude. From the start, I was drawn to the intersection between numbers and behaviorâ€”how data can explain decisions, predict outcomes, and create real change.
    </p>

    <p>
      I began my career analyzing green bonds and sustainable loans, helping fund environmental and social impact projects. Later, I transitioned into marketing analytics, uncovering insights from user behavior and leading strategies to connect brands more meaningfully with their audiences. Along the way, I also co-founded a platform for young entrepreneurs across Latin America, driven by the belief that access and support can transform futures. That same drive brought me to California, where Iâ€™m now pursuing my Masterâ€™s in Business Analytics at UC Irvine as the first-ever recipient of the Merage LATAM Scholarship. Moving abroad and starting over wasnâ€™t easy, but it sharpened my adaptability, resilience, and purpose.
    </p>

    <p>
      Today, I work at the intersection of business, technology, and impact. I use Python, SQL, and machine learning to transform messy data into clear directionâ€”whether that means helping companies understand their customers, optimize performance, or invest more sustainably. My work bridges the technical and the human, and I always ask: how can this insight make someoneâ€™s life better?
    </p>

    <p><em>Iâ€™m not just here to analyze data. Iâ€™m here to change what we do with it.</em></p>
